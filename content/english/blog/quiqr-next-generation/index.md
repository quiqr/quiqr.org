After some explorations and with the arrival of [@bert-janzwanepol](https://github.com/bert-janzwanepol) as new core member, we have now really started to catch up on an enormous backlog. In a [separate branch](https://github.com/quiqr/quiqr-desktop/tree/ng), we are updating everything to the latest versions. This is meticulous work, but it's going surprisingly smoothly and the outlook is promising. Our global objectives are as follows:

- Rewriting all JavaScript to TypeScript
- Upgrading React from 16 to 19
- Converting all Class-based code to Functional code
- Migrating from WebPack to Vite
- Migrating from ElectronBuilder to ElectronForge
- Packages for all regular platforms: Windows, Linux, and MacOS
- In addition to a desktop version, also a server version for in the browser
- Complete Nix/NixOS development and build expressions
- Providing test scripts linked to GH pipelines

For now, the old (legacy) Quiqr version will continue to exist, but there will come a time when Quiqr Next Generation is the only supported version.

Keep an eye on this project and let us know if you want to help.
